# Changelog

## v5.0.0-rc.2 / 2019-01-22

An incorrect version has been released which required this release version bump. Re-built the package-lock file to generate latest package dependencies

## v5.0.0-rc.1 / 2019-01-18

### Release candidate with various bug fixes / code refactoring and dependency upgrades

#### Bug Fixes

* Fix channel filtering for non-admins 
* Handle responses without timestamps

  * Replace the verifification mechanism to be instanceof Date instead of typeof
* Add a shebang character to the url of the transaction link 
  * Add missing ! to links
* update the 'update' object which is checked when creating metrics so that metrics are created with mediators
* Include time in filter dates
* Determine user access level using channel permission groups (non-admin user can retrieve transaction body when requesting multiple transactions - reporting as no admin user)

* Don't set secureProtocol - already supported in supported versions of Node.js
