Description: OpenHIM Core
 The OpenHIM core component is responsible for providing a single entry-point into an HIE as well as providing the following key features:
 - Point of service client authentication and authorization
 - Persistence and audit logging of all messages that flow through the OpenHIM
 - Routing of messages to the correct service provider (be it an HIM orchestrator for further orchestration or the actual intended service provider)
