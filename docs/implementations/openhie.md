OpenHIE
===============

OpenHIE is an initiative that aims to provide a reference architecture and workflow specifications for sharing health information between point of care systems in low resource settings. It aims to be standards-based and open such that components of the architecture can be swapped out as is necessary. OpenHIE is made up of a number of sub-communities that each aim to discuss a particular component of the architecture. Each community maintains a reference implementation of their particular component.

For more information see the [OpenHIE website](http://ohie.org/).

## How the OpenHIM is used

The OpenHIM acts as a reference implementation of the interoperability layer component within the OpenHIE architecture. To learn more about this component please see the [interoperability layer community wiki](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/SUB/Interoperability+Layer+Community).
